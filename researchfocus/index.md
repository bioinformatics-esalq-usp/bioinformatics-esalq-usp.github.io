Our main research interest is in the application of Bioinformatics to Bioenergy. We also work on the interface between Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics, with emphasis on applications to plant breeding.

Our specific research topics include:

- Sugarcane Genome Assembly
We are part of the consortium focused on creating a reference genome assembly of the highly polyploid and complex sugarcane genome. This entails whole-genome shotgun and BAC sequencing and assembly, as well as the development of algorithms directed at performing such tasks.

- Polyploid Genotyping
Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) is an approach being currently used for genotyping many important species, especially less well studied organisms. Methodology is available for analysis of diploid data only; hence we are interested in devising methods specifically for polyploid genotyping.

- Functional Genomics
We are also interested in the evaluation of gene expression in various contexts. In particular, we want to study changes to the transcriptome brought about by plant breeding practices over time. In the case of polyploid species, we want to study the effects of allele dosage on allelic expression.

- Sugarcane Evolution
A long-term goal of the group is to help unravel events that happened during polyploidization of the sugarcane genome from its closest known diploid relative, sorghum.

- Genomic Selection
Use of molecular marker information to aid plant breeding, through genomic selection, is being studied for high biomass sorghum. We want to take a more functional approach, leveraging gene annotation information to improve selection models.
