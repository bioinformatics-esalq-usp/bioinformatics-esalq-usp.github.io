The Bioinformatics group at the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture, University of SÂ‹o Paulo, began its activities on October 2013. 

Our new group is focused on Bioinformatics applied to Bioenergy, including important crops for biofuel production in Brazil and worldwide. We are currently working on sugarcane and high biomass sorghum breeding. We focus on facing challenges that cannot be solved by traditional breeding alone, while keeping in mind that the long-term goal is to help breeding programs.

We value independent thinking above all, but strongly encourage scientific interaction among students and researchers alike. Collaborative research is what we believe moves science forward, so we interact with Universities in Brazil and abroad, public research institutions and the private sector.

The group is open for applications and has some pre-approved scholarships for graduate students.
